## üìã Concept
Users kunnen een account aanmaken, hiermee inloggen en op basis van hun favoriete kleur gematched worden met andere users.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository to your own device:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/deannabosschert/Matcher.git
```
Then, navigate to this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Last,

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build scripts
#### predev
Also included: a predev script that runs `build:css` which is specified in the gulpfile.js pipeline to build css from `./src/styles.scss` (which is sass) and place the compiled css file in `public/dist`.

#### prebuild
The dist folder will be emptied and filled with a new css file every time you call `npm run dev` by running a script `prebuild` that runs `rimraf ./public/dist` which is a prebuild:css script so this will always happen right before the css is built.

#### watcher
On top of that we've included a watch:css script which watches my src folder for any changes that are made to the css and html (hbs) files and proxies a server to port 3001 by using browsersync, every time changes are made to css this refreshes the page with the new css changes you've made.

[Heres](https://github.com/ReiniervanLimpt/project-tech-21/blob/main/gulpfile.js) a link to the gulpfile which includes the sass and watch script.

## Resources used:
[browsersync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync)
[gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)
[rimraf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf)
[nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
[handlebars templating](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)

#### Environment variables
Link your own database by creating a .env with the following:

```json
PORT=3000
DB_NAME="${yourdatabasename}"
C_NAME=${yourcollection}
DB_URL=${yourdburl}
SESSION_SECRET=1

```

## üóÉ Data

### üêí API
_What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties?_ 

Ik gebruik de ColorAPI, te vinden op https://www.thecolorapi.com/.

Hier haal ik de 'named color' op van de user, en gebruik ik de data van complementaire kleuren als matcher.


#### Properties
Every color object returned by the API

Is named (from a matched dataset of over 2000 names+colors)
e.g. #24B1E0 == Cerulean
Has an image URL for demonstration
e.g. Cerulean image
Is transposed into hex, rgb, cmyk, hsl, hsv and XYZ formats
Is matched to a best-contrst color for text overlay, etc

#### Rate limiting
Niet vermeld!

### üíΩ Data cleaning
_What has been done with the fetched data?_What has been done with the initial data? Cleaning pattern?

De wachtwoorden van de user worden gehashed alvorens in de database gestored

```js
    const user = {
              username: req.body.userSignup,
              email: req.body.emailSignup.toLowerCase(),
              hash: req.body.passwordSignup,
              description: '',
              age: '',
              location: '',
              avatar: ''
            }
```

outcome:
```json
    const user = {
              username: req.body.userSignup,
              email: req.body.emailSignup.toLowerCase(),
              hash: hash,
              description: '',
              age: '',
              location: '',
              avatar: ''
            }
```

A live version of this fully responsive application is running [here](https://be-matcher.herokuapp.com/)  
I suggest checking out the [Wiki](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher/wiki) for information on the process.  

## ‚úÖ To-do
- [x] Update readme
- [x] Update wiki further
- [x] Add another feature
- [ ] Build scripts
- [ ] Improve error-handling
- [ ] PWA (+ improve accessibility, render-blocking, etc)

## üìã Concept
This Matcher repository is for 'MapMatcher' a _"datingsite"_ that tries to connect people that want to go to the same destination.  
It will take in your preferences and criteria and match you with people whose criteria you match.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository to your own device:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher.git
```
Then, navigate to this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

To start:

```bash
npm start
```

But please be advised that you will need a [.env-file like the example I've provided](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher/blob/main/.env.example)

## üóÉ Data

Data in this application is coming from a mongodb server.  
You can populate this yourself, taking note of what it should look like in the [User model](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher/blob/main/models/user.js).   
Or by letting users register themselves.
