# Matcher

I suggest checking out the [Wiki](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher/wiki) for information on the progress and process.  
This readme will soon hold relevant information.  
Probably as soon as I finish some CSS so I can add an image of the website and can make this Readme pretty.
