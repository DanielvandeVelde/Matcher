A live version of this application is running [here](https://be-matcher.herokuapp.com/)

- [ ] Add another feature
- [ ] Build scripts
- [ ] Improve error-handling
- [ ] PWA (+ improve accessibility, render-blocking, etc)
- [ ] Add states

## 📋 Concept
This Matcher repository is for 'MapMatcher' a _"datingsite"_ that tries to connect people that want to go to the same destination.  
It will take in your preferences and criteria and match you with people whose criteria you match.  

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone this repository to your own device:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher.git
```
Then, navigate to this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

To start:

```bash
npm start
```

But please be advised that you will need a [.env-file like the example I've provided](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher/blob/main/.env.example)

## 🗃 Data

Data in this application is coming from a mongodb server.  
You can populate this yourself, taking note of what it should look like in the [User model](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher/blob/main/models/user.js).   
Or by letting users register themselves.
