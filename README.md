## üìã Concept
This Matcher repository is for 'MapMatcher' a _"datingsite"_ that tries to connect people that want to go to the same destination.  
It will take in your preferences and criteria and match you with people whose criteria you match.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository to your own device:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher.git
```
Then, navigate to this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Last,

```bash
npm start
```

## üóÉ Data

Data in this application is coming from a mongodb server.  
You can populate this yourself, taking note of what it should look like in the [User model](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/Matcher/blob/main/models/user.js). 
Or by letting users register themselves.
